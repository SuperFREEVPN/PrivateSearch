 Best Private Search Engine


Privacia.org : Uses Google technology without the tracking, to provide an anonymous and smooth browsing experience.

Privacia is the first-ever and arguably the world’s most private search engine currently available. It offers robust search results, customizable settings, and leading consumer privacy protection features.

The experience is very straight-forward and their search results are consistently more relevant than other private search engines. This is most likely because they leverage Google search technology, without any tracking; while other private search engines are largely dependent on Yahoo and BING’s search feed.

Privacia does exceptionally well in the area of user privacy. It does not track, log any user data or share information with third parties. Their headquarter office and main servers are based in the Netherlands, meaning all global users are protected by Dutch and EU privacy laws which are some of the most stringent in the world. Additionally, Privacia has passed independent (EuroPrise organization) audits of their privacy and data-handling practices.

To make searching simple, Privacia can be set as your default search engine on leading browsers or can be installed as an extension add-on. They offer multiple ways to personalize your settings to make it your own and search the way you want. They also have a very responsive and helpful international support team that patiently assists users with easy to complex issues.

Finally, Privacia offers a very useful private browsing feature called “Anonymous View.” With this proxy feature, users can view images, videos, news, and entire websites with no tracking or trace. Every time you search on Privacia, an “Anonymous View” link will appear next to your search results, by clicking this link they will hide your IP address and user agent to other sites.
